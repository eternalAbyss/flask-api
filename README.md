# Test case for concurrency test in flask

This branch is for the test cases related to checking if the flask application is serving multiple requests as it is supposed to.
I will be adding code to configure it manually and then test it.

When you run it in your local machine please change the `request_count` according to your hardware so that it does not crashes.
